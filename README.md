# FL Studio Preset for M-VAVE SMK-25 MIDI Keyboard

I created a preset for FL Studio that enables full functionality with the **M-VAVE SMK-25 MIDI keyboard**. The preset is written in Python. I decided to share it on GitHub so others can use it as well.

## Installation

1. Import the preset `preset1.mkc` using **MidiSuite.exe**.
2. Place the `mvave-smk25` folder in:
   `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Hardware`
   (Replace `<user>` with your Windows username.)
3. Launch **FL Studio** and select the preset:
   `Options -> MIDI Settings -> Input -> Controller Type (M-VAVE SMK-25)`.

## Features
- All functional buttons (**Play, Stop, Rec**, etc.) work.
- **Keys, pads, and knobs** are fully mapped.
- Knobs control **channel volume**.

## Feedback
Feel free to leave suggestions or report issues in the **"Issues"** section.
If I have free time and motivation, Iâ€™ll add more presets for the **M-VAVE SMK-25**.
